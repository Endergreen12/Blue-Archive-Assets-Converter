## How to get MediaCatalog.bytes

The tool needs the MediaCatalog.bytes in the MediaPatch folder to handle MediaPatch files,

but apparently the game deletes that file after initializing the data

To keep the MediaCatalog.bytes, you need to quit the game when the "Initialize Media Catalog" is around 99% after starting the game
